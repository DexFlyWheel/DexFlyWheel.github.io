# DexFlyWheel Project Page

This is the project page for DexFlyWheel: A Scalable and Self-improving Data Generation Framework for Dexterous Manipulation.

## Project Overview

DexFlyWheel is a novel framework that enables scalable and self-improving data generation for dexterous manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates:

- Efficient data generation framework from single demonstrations
- Self-improving pipeline through policy learning
- Successful transfer to real robot systems
- Strong performance scaling with diverse datasets
